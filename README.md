# IBM_Capstone_Project
 
this is mainly use for IBM data science course assigment .


 Instruction  : 
Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.


Things I learn from this project :
- How to scrape data from webpage.
- How to explore data .
- How to prepare data to fitting model.
- How to choose suitable model .
- How to find inside from data and result of model.



Other note :
- If you want to see map download notebook
- If you want to see non - technical conclusion open presentation.pdf(or powerpoint).
- scraping and merging data had done in seperate notebook in order to make main notebook look cleaner ( you can still see it in Web_scraping.ipynb and merge_table.ipynb.)
- main notebook's name is  Capstone_project.ipynb.
